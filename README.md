I am writing this after i completed the project so it is more of a reflection...

This project is about getting to build your first website after doing the first part in The Odin Project. It uses most if not all of the things that they cover in the beginner html course. I already knew a bit coming into The Odin Project so everything was quite familiar to me but it still felt refreshing to do i all over again from scratch in which I felt i was kinda fun. The project includes using headers, lists both unorded and orded but also links and putting in images. I chose to also use divs in my project to make sure everything was fitted togheter. 

I do know some CSS but i figuered I skip that since the course doesn't include any CSS yet since it is in the next chapter. 

(And also I didn't feel like bragging on what i believe to be the easiest project in the course and instead just stick to what was brought up and work through it.)

I didn't stress through the project and did it across a weekend and spent maybe 3-4 hours on building and changing it to my liking.
