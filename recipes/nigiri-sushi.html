        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h4>Sushi rice</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place the rice in a saucepan. Rinse the rice until the water 
                looks clear.<br> Pour it off. Add water. Leave for 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir the rice. Boil the water. Cover with a lid, reduce the heat 
                to the<br> lowest possible. Simmer for 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the pan from the heat. Leave for 10-20 minutes <br>without lifting the lid.</li>
            <li>
                Place the rice in a large porcelain dish. Sprinkle the rice vinegar over <br>the rice. 
                Cut slits in the rice with a spatula or large spoon. Carefully<br> mix the vinegar with 
                the rice without mashing the rice grains.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>After the rice is finished</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the fish into 3-4 mm thick slices, preferably rectangles,<br> approx. 3x6 cm.</li>
            <li>Form small egg-shaped balls of the rice with moistened hands.</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of wasabi on the rice ball and top with a slice<br> of fish.</li>
        </ol>
